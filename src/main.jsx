// Always a clean createRoot — never hydrateRoot. #root ships real markup on
// prerendered/crawler-stub routes, but none of it can be hydrated against:
//
//   1. api/news-article.js, api/news-index.js, api/webinar.js, and
//      api/guide-article.js/api/guides-index.js inject hand-written HTML
//      stubs (marked data-ssr-stub) for crawlers — not real React output, so
//      the markup never matches what the client renders.
//
//   2. scripts/prerender.mjs snapshots are real React output, but from a
//      LIVE, animating page — framer-motion writes inline styles
//      continuously, so whatever frame Puppeteer caught gets baked into the
//      committed file (verifiably, e.g. `transform: translateX(0.55724px)`).
//      React's first client render emits each component's `initial` styles
//      instead, which can't match those sub-pixel values, so hydrateRoot
//      failed with React #418 on every visit and React discarded the whole
//      prerendered tree and rebuilt it client-side.
//
// That teardown-and-rebuild isn't just wasted work for human visitors —
// Googlebot's rendering pass executes this same JS and judges the page on
// the post-rebuild DOM, not the raw HTML. Caught mid-teardown (or before
// useAuth/usePro/useCohortSchedule resolve), the page can look empty enough
// to get flagged a soft 404 — confirmed 2026-09-16 on /vibe-coding via
// Search Console, despite the served HTML being fully populated.
//
// This exact fix shipped once before (2026-08-19) and was reverted minutes
// later with no recorded reason — which is how the regression above went
// unnoticed. Re-running the prerender does NOT fix it; it just bakes a
// different random frame. hydrateRoot only becomes viable again if mount
// animations are dropped from prerendered routes, making the first client
// render deterministic. Until then, createRoot is correct, not a shortcut —
// don't reintroduce hydrateRoot without solving that first.
