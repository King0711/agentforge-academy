// Single source of truth for displayed prices — Pricing.jsx, Home.jsx, and
// AIBuilder.jsx all read from here so a price change is a one-line edit,
// not a hunt across pages. Must stay in sync with the webhook's own price
// checks (supabase/functions/paystack-webhook/index.ts PRICES), which is
// the actual source of truth for what gets charged/granted server-side —
// and with create-paystack-checkout's own PRICES constant, which is what
// actually determines the amount sent to Paystack. Also duplicated (not
// imported — a pre-existing drift risk, not introduced by this change) in
// TheOfferSlide.jsx and webinarSlides.js for the live webinar deck.

// Repriced 2026-09-22: Builder 1/Builder 2/Pro moved from a ₦25,000/
// ₦25,000/₦45,000 six-month subscription (live cohort + AI Builder
// credits) to permanent, guides-only access — see
// supabase/guide-purchases-setup.sql. Builder 1 and Builder 2 no longer
// share one price (Builder 2, the more advanced track, costs more), so
// there's no single BUILDER_PRICE constant anymore. No anchor/savings
// framing at this price point — a struck-through ₦100,000 next to ₦5,000
// would read as a fabricated 95%-off claim, not a real discount.

// "just get Pro" the default for anyone leaning toward wanting both.

// Vibe Coding bootcamp — a separate live-cohort product, not a tier of the
// builder1/builder2/pro ladder above. Priced independently; happens to land
// at the same amount as AI Agent Mastery below. Added 2026-09-08.
export const VIBECODING_PRICE = 25000;

// AI Agent Mastery — a new live-cohort product (added 2026-09-22): build a
// personal-assistant agent, at price parity with Vibe Coding. Not a tier of
// the builder1/builder2/pro ladder either.
